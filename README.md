# **‚öôÔ∏è Implementation**

## Data Preprocessing (Python)
- Hospital dataset provided in two database tables (patients, payers) plus CSVs (encounters, organization, procedures).
- Steps:
  1. Load CSVs and append records into the hospital database.
  2. Convert fields to correct data types (e.g., datetime).
----
## **SQL Analysis**

### **Encounters Overview**

**A. How many total encounters occurred each year?**

Implementation Plan:
  - Extract the year from the encounter date.
  - Counted encounters per year.
  - Grouped by year, sort chronologically.

```sql
SELECT STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) AS EncounterYear,
		COUNT(*) AS TotalEncounter
FROM encounters
GROUP BY STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) 
ORDER BY EncounterYear ;

```
**Output:**
<img width="857" height="428" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ebb1c4-ee17-42f5-9368-846f016ca21b" />

Interpretation:
- Rising encounters ‚Üí higher demand, need for more staff/resources.
- Falling encounters ‚Üí could be access issues, patient leakage, or improved community health.
- 
Be aware of Data caveats: date quality (missing or incorrect timestamps), double entries, canceled visits.
                 
**B. Percentage of Encounters by Encounter class per year**

Implementation Plan:
  - Get total encounters per year and class.
  - Get total encounters per year.
  - Divided class counts by year totals to compute percentages.
  - Return a year‚Äìclass‚Äìpercentage table.

```sql
WITH class_count AS (SELECT STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) AS EncounterYear,
						COUNT(*) AS ClassEncounter_Count, ENCOUNTERCLASS 
						FROM encounters
						GROUP BY STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ), ENCOUNTERCLASS),

	total_count AS (SELECT STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) AS EncounterYear,
						COUNT(*) AS TotalEncounter
						FROM encounters
						GROUP BY STRFTIME("%Y", "START")
)
SELECT c.EncounterYear, c.ENCOUNTERCLASS,
		ROUND(100.0* c.ClassEncounter_Count/t.TotalEncounter,2) AS pct_of_totalencounter
FROM class_count c JOIN total_count t
ON c.EncounterYear = t.EncounterYear
ORDER BY t.EncounterYear, pct_of_totalencounter;
```
**Output:**
<img width="1017" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa96ccac-be5e-45c8-99fc-97fbb8648414" />

Interpretation:
- A high emergency or urgent care % might indicate access barriers to primary care.
- Rising inpatient % could suggest sicker patient populations or poor outpatient management.

Watch for missing or unknown classes for this may dilute percentages.


**C. Peecentage of encounters, over 24 hours versus under 24 hours**

Implementation Plan:
- Computed duration per encounter in hours.
- Bucket into <24h vs ‚â•24h.
- Aggregated counts by bucket.
- Used a window to compute the percentage share.

```sql
WITH duration AS (SELECT STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) AS EncounterYear,
							ROUND((JULIANDAY("STOP") -JULIANDAY("START"))*24,2) AS hours_stayed
						FROM encounters e 
						WHERE START IS NOT NULL AND STOP IS NOT NULL),

buckets_24hr AS (SELECT EncounterYear,
				 CASE WHEN hours_stayed >= 24.0 THEN ">24H" ELSE "<24H" END AS Length_of_Stay
				FROM duration),
		
yr_agg AS (SELECT EncounterYear, 
					Length_of_Stay,
					COUNT(*) AS Encounter_Count
			FROM buckets_24hr 
			GROUP BY EncounterYear, Length_of_Stay
	)

SELECT EncounterYear, 
		Length_of_Stay,
		ROUND(100.0 * Encounter_Count/
				SUM(Encounter_Count) 
				OVER(PARTITION BY EncounterYear),2) AS pct_of_total
FROM yr_agg
ORDER BY EncounterYear, Length_of_Stay;
```
**Output:**
<img width="1022" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7febc5c6-1ec0-4f69-b2dc-5f44122d5f84" />

Interpretation:
- High `‚â•24h` share ‚Üí more bed-days, higher inpatient load; investigate admission criteria and discharge processes.
- If `<24h` dominates, throughput is high or case mix is ambulatory/ED fast-track heavy.

Watch out for  missing/NULL timestamps, timezone inconsistencies.  Consider outlier caps and audits.

### **Cost & Coverage**

This analysis complements the story by showing what is most common, what is most expensive, and who pays‚Äîand how much.

**A. Queries to assess payer coverage and percentage of total encounter each represent.**

Implementation

Query 1 ‚Äì Overall zero coverage & % of all encounters

  - Filter encounters where `payer_coverage` <= 0.
  - Count those encounters.
  - Divided by all encounters to get the overall percentage.
  - Round to a presentable integer.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ZeroCoverage_Encounters,
		ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM encounters) ,0) AS pct_of_total
FROM encounters e 
WHERE e.PAYER_COVERAGE <= 0;
```
**Output:**
<img width="938" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcaaabd3-cb0b-4dfa-ab8f-3493e8934ebd" />


Query 2 ‚Äì Compare ‚ÄúZeroCover‚Äù vs ‚ÄúCovered‚Äù

  - Bucket each encounter into `ZeroCover` vs `Covered` in a CTE.
  - Divide each bucket by all encounters (same denominator) to make shares comparable.
  - Group by `Coverage_Status` and count.
  - Order by percentage or by status for stable presentation.

```sql
WITH coverage AS (SELECT 
					CASE 
						WHEN PAYER_COVERAGE <= 0 OR PAYER_COVERAGE IS NULL THEN "ZeroCover" ELSE "Covered" 
						END AS Coverage_Status
					FROM encounters)

SELECT Coverage_Status, COUNT(*) Encounter_Count,
		ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM encounters) ,0) AS pct_of_total
FROM coverage
GROUP BY Coverage_Status 
ORDER BY pct_of_total ;
```
**Output:**
<img width="1043" height="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edca2be6-e461-407d-890e-92b3c4d1f964" />

Interpretation:
- Overall % `ZeroCover`: High share - larger uncompensated-care burden; expect bad debt/charity care to rise.
- Low share - more reimbursable workload; better revenue stability.

**B. Top 10 most frequent procedures**

Implementation:
    - Aggregate by `DESCRIPTION` from procedures.
    - Count rows = frequency of each procedure.
    - Compute average `BASE_COST`.
    - Order by frequency descending.
    - Limit output to 10 rows.

```sql
-- b. Top 10 most frequent procedures performed and the average base cost for each?
SELECT  p.DESCRIPTION , COUNT(*) AS Encounter_Count,
		ROUND(AVG(p.BASE_COST),2) AS Average_Cost
FROM procedures p 
GROUP BY DESCRIPTION 
ORDER BY Encounter_Count DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
**Output:**
<img width="1080" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc12b7c-58b4-4dcb-a7b6-df833736c508" />

Interpretation

- Most frequent procedures;
    - Shows workload drivers: what the hospital does most often.
    - Often these are routine, lower-cost interventions.
      
High frequency may point to resource allocation needs (staff, supplies).

**C.Top 10 highest average-cost procedures**

Implementation:

- Normalize `DESCRIPTION` (e.g., `TRIM(LOWER(...))`) to reduce duplicates from inconsistent casing.
- Compute average `BASE_COST` and encounter count.
- Order by average cost descending.
- Limit output to 10 rows
  
```sql
SELECT  TRIM(LOWER(p.DESCRIPTION)) AS Descrption, ROUND(AVG(p.BASE_COST),2) AS Average_Cost,
		COUNT(*) AS Encounter_Count
FROM procedures p 
GROUP BY DESCRIPTION 
ORDER BY Average_Cost DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
**Output:**
<img width="1187" height="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125c9cf7-a259-4609-9a51-64d6fc86d88c" />

Interpretation:

- Highest-cost procedures
    - Identifies financially intensive services.
    - These may not occur often but heavily impact costs/revenue.
      
Useful for budgeting, negotiation with payers, and identifying candidates for cost-control strategies.

**D. Average claim cost per payer and encounter class**

Implementation
- Join `encounters` to `payers` on `payer_id`.
- Group by `ENCOUNTERCLASS`.
- Count encounters and compute average `TOTAL_CLAIM_COST`.
- Present payer + encounter class breakdown.

```sql
SELECT e.ENCOUNTERCLASS, COUNT(*) AS Encounter_Count,
	ROUND(AVG(e.TOTAL_CLAIM_COST),2) AS Average_Claim_Cost, 
	p.NAME 
FROM encounters e INNER JOIN payers p 
ON e.PAYER = p.Id 
GROUP BY e.ENCOUNTERCLASS;
````
**Output:**
<img width="1022" height="275" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f5d03e7-521b-4c71-a97d-0a5da9aba15f" />

Interpretation:
- Average claim cost by payer & encounter class;
    - Compares utilization and cost patterns across payer contracts.
    - High averages may reflect sicker patients, higher procedure intensity, or inefficient care delivery.

Useful for financial planning and payer negotiations: some payers may systematically reimburse lower/higher amounts.

Encounter class split (inpatient vs outpatient vs ED) shows where costs concentrate.

-----

### **Patient Behavior**

**A. Unique patients admitted each quarter over time**

Implementation plan

  1. Extract `EncounterYear` from `START` (admission date).
  2. Compute quarter: `(month ‚Äì 1)/3 + 1`.
  3. Filter for inpatient encounters (`LOWER(encounterclass) = 'inpatient'`).
  4. Count unique patients per year‚Äìquarter (`COUNT(DISTINCT Id`)
  5. Use a window function to calculate the % of yearly admissions each quarter contributed.
  6.  Order results by year and quarter.

```sql
WITH qtr AS (SELECT STRFTIME("%Y", "START" ) AS EncounterYear,
				COUNT(DISTINCT (e.Id)) AS Patient_Count, 
				(CAST(STRFTIME("%m", "START" ) AS INT)-1)/3 + 1 AS EncounterQuarter 		
			FROM encounters e 
			WHERE LOWER(e.ENCOUNTERCLASS) = "inpatient"
			GROUP BY EncounterYear, EncounterQuarter 
			
			)
SELECT 	EncounterYear,
		Patient_Count,
		EncounterQuarter,
		ROUND(100.0 * Patient_Count/ SUM(Patient_Count) 
				OVER(PARTITION BY EncounterYear),2) AS pct_of_year
FROM qtr 
ORDER BY EncounterYear, EncounterQuarter ;
```
**Output**
<img width="913" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff06ee5-8210-496b-9074-1008b3139b2f" />

Interpretation

- Shows seasonality of admissions.
    - pct_of_year highlights distribution‚Äîif Q3 = 40%, capacity/staffing may need to shift.
    - Outliers (very low/high quarter %s) can indicate unusual events (e.g., epidemics, policy change).


**B. Patients readmitted within 30 days**

Implementation plan

1. Use ROW_NUMBER() to order encounters chronologically per patient.
2. Self-join each encounter with its next for the same patient.
3. Calculate gap: JULIANDAY(next.START) - JULIANDAY(curr.STOP).
4. Flag if gap is BETWEEN 0 AND 30.
5. Return index encounter, discharge date, readmit encounter, readmit date, and readmit flag.
6. (validation): Additional query checks negatives (bad timestamp order) and >365d gaps (potential outliers or long gaps).

```sql
-- b. How many patients were readmitted within 30 days of a previous encounter?
WITH ordered AS (SELECT 	e.Id AS Encounter_Id, 
							e. START, 
							e. STOP, 
							e. PATIENT,
						ROW_NUMBER() 
							OVER(PARTITION BY e.PATIENT ORDER BY START) AS rn
					FROM encounters e 
					WHERE e.START IS NOT NULL AND e.STOP IS NOT NULL
),

paired AS (
			SELECT 	curr.PATIENT,
					curr.Encounter_Id AS current_encounter,
					curr."STOP" AS discharge_date,
					nxt.Encounter_Id AS readmit_encounter,
					nxt."START" AS Readmit_Date,
					ROUND(JULIANDAY(nxt."START") - JULIANDAY(curr."STOP"),0) AS days_to_readmit
			FROM ordered curr
			LEFT JOIN ordered nxt
				ON curr.PATIENT = nxt.PATIENT AND nxt.rn = curr.rn + 1
		)
SELECT 	PATIENT,
		current_encounter,
		discharge_date,
		readmit_encounter,
		days_to_readmit,
		CASE WHEN days_to_readmit BETWEEN 0 AND 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS readmit_30d
FROM paired
ORDER BY PATIENT, discharge_date;
```
```sql
WITH ordered AS (SELECT 	e.Id AS Encounter_Id, 
							e. START, 
							e. STOP, 
							e. PATIENT,
						ROW_NUMBER() 
							OVER(PARTITION BY e.PATIENT ORDER BY START) AS rn
					FROM encounters e 
					WHERE e.START IS NOT NULL AND e.STOP IS NOT NULL
),

paired AS (
			SELECT 	curr.PATIENT,
					curr.Encounter_Id AS current_encounter,
					curr."STOP" AS discharge_date,
					nxt.Encounter_Id AS readmit_encounter,
					nxt."START" AS Readmit_Date,
					ROUND(JULIANDAY(nxt."START") - JULIANDAY(curr."STOP"),0) AS days_to_readmit
			FROM ordered curr
			LEFT JOIN ordered nxt
				ON curr.PATIENT = nxt.PATIENT AND nxt.rn = curr.rn + 1
		)
		
SELECT 	SUM(days_to_readmit < 0) AS negatives,
		SUM(days_to_readmit > 365) AS over_year
FROM (paired);
```

Interpretation

- Readmission within 30 days: Core quality/safety indicator.
    - High % suggests poor discharge planning, inadequate follow-up, or high illness burden.
    - Low % indicates better care transitions
----
#### **Summary of Analysis**

**Learnings**

- Patient encounters can be analyzed by year, quarter, month, week, day, or hour using SQLite date functions.
- Coverage metrics (covered vs. zero coverage) reveal the financial health of encounters and highlight equity gaps.
- Length of stay (LOS) buckets (<24h vs ‚â•24h) provide insights into resource utilization and inpatient workload.
- Procedures analysis identifies the most frequent and costliest services, informing operational and financial priorities.
- Readmission analysis (30-day) links encounters chronologically by patient to measure care quality and discharge effectiveness.
- Data quality checks (negative stays, extreme gaps, NULL values) are essential to ensure valid conclusions.

**Impact on Patient Care**

- Identifies high-risk periods (quarterly admission surges) for better staffing and preparedness.
- Highlights gaps in continuity of care through 30-day readmission metrics, guiding post-discharge interventions.
- Detects access barriers when zero coverage is high, supporting outreach and patient support programs.
- Provides insight into clinical practice patterns (frequent and costly procedures), enabling targeted quality improvement.

**Business Value for the Hospital**

- Financial sustainability: quantifying uncompensated care (zero coverage) helps anticipate revenue risks.
- Operational efficiency: LOS and encounter trends support capacity planning, bed management, and workforce allocation.
- Regulatory alignment: 30-day readmission tracking aligns with quality benchmarks and can mitigate financial penalties.
- Strategic planning: procedure mix and cost insights guide investment decisions and service line prioritization.
- Equity and reputation: demonstrating awareness of access and coverage issues strengthens the hospital‚Äôs public trust and policy influence.
